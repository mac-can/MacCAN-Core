 *
 *  @brief     MacCAN - macOS User-Space Driver for CAN to USB Interfaces.
 *
 *             Running CAN and CAN FD on a Mac is the mission of the MacCAN
 *             project. MacCAN-Core is an abstraction or rather a wrapper
 *             of Apple's IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for
 *             CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.
 *
 *  @note      This header file provides all data types and defines for the
 *             creation of an USB driver for CAN interfaces under macOS.
 *             The provided data types and defines are compatible with the
 *             CAN API V3 wrapper specification (C part of this header).
 *
 *             It also provides an abstract class with pure virtual methods
 *             as an interface specification for derived MacCAN USB driver
 *             implementation classes (C++ part of this header).
 *
 *             The MacCAN class CMacCAN provides two static methods to
 *             initialize and shutdown the MacCAN IOUsbKit. These methods
 *             must be called at the beginning / at the end of a MacCAN
 *             application or in the initializer / in the finalizer
 *             function of a dynamic library.
 *
 *             Additionally the class CMacCAN provides static methods for
 *             bit-rate conversion using CiA bit-timing indexes as base.
